# Pathfinding-Visualizer

 ### Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s and A\* Search Algorithm in Python to find the shortest route between two cells in a grid and visualized their workflow using a 2D graphics module called Pygame

 This is a project where I kind of followed along this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=869s&ab_channel=TechWithTim) to understand the applications of Object-Oriented-Programming and how A\* Pathfinding algorithm works. However, I added my own spin on this and implemented another algorithm(Dijkstra's) in this project. Besides, this tutorial helped me understand the inner workings of algorithm visualization. Later I applied the knowledge that I gained in another project of mine, which was a [Sorting Visualizer](https://github.com/ShowmickKar/Sorting-Visualizer).
